Overview

The goals of this assignment are that you will:

Learn how to simulate hardware or sensor inputs
Learn how to enable communication between two devices (a simulated hardware piece and a mobile app)
Explore some visualization of sensing data
Continue learning the Kinoma Platform API
You will build a pet feeder companion app.

As connected devices increasingly streamline our lives, one "user" group is missing: pets. Pets want to be techy and healthy - they want to enjoy the right amount of food at a regular schedule. They need a smart system that automatically feeds them and keeps track of their diet.

For this assignment, you will be building a pet feeder simulator and its companion mobile app for the real users: pet owners. You will specify one pet type (e.g., dogs, cats, rabbit, reptiles, or some imaginary creatures). You will define what the feeder can sense and perform. The feeder should sense more than one kind of pet activities, such as the amount of food or water taken, the weight of the pet, or photos. Your system will track the information and make it accessible to the users via a mobile app. In turn, the users can control the feeder through the app, such as setting up a feeding schedule or playing music.
